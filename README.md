## Team B, group B

- CHEDID Julien
- DAMASSE Thomas
- DUGNY Gabriel

## Setup

- Java 1.8
- IntelliJ 2019.2 Ultimate

## Code explanation

The test package is used to test some methods to compute scores.

The yahtzee package is the main package. Main is the entrypoint.

The code still needs some refactoring, with even better code separation between game logic and JavaFX logic (controller).
With better separation, code would be clearer and simpler to maintain.
